Introduction to CI/CD
A CI/CD pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software. Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are a practice focused on improving software delivery using either a DevOps or site reliability engineering (SRE) approach.
A CI/CD pipeline introduces monitoring and automation to improve the process of application development, particularly at the integration and testing phases, as well as during delivery and deployment. Although it is possible to manually execute each of the steps of a CI/CD pipeline, the true value of CI/CD pipelines is realized through automation.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Requirement analysis
Plan/Design
Software design such as architectural design
Software Development
Testing
Deployment
Problems in traditional SDLC:
scale and complexity
manual and slow process
broken communication
human errors
large volume of testing
long deployment window
high costs
DevOps in SDLC:
DevOps came to help modern SDLC - Agile (collaboration, automation)
Stages:
Continuous Development
Continuous Testing
Continuous Integration
Continuous Delivery/Deployment
Continuous Monitoring
CI- Continuous Integration - is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several

CD - Coninuous Deliver/Deployment

is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring thet the software
...
WHY CI/CD:

reduce cost
faster release rate
smaller code changes
more test reliability
easy maintainance and updates
